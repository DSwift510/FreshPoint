Install Python (Windows)
---------------------------------------
1.  In your browser navigate to https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

2.  Download the latest version of Python (at the time of writing 3.6) from the official website. 
    If you want to be sure you are installing a fully up-to-date version, click the Downloads > Windows link from the home page of the Python.org web site.

3. By design, Python installs to a directory with the version number embedded, e.g. Python version 3.6 will install at C:\Python36\

*Note only one interpreter can be the default application for Python file types. If you have Python 2.7 installed You will need to modify the PATH environment variable.

4. Add the directories for your default Python version to the PATH. Assuming that your Python installation is in C:\Python36\, add this to your PATH: C:\Python36\;C:\Python36\Scripts\

[HINT]You can do this easily by running the following in powershell: [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;C:\Python36\;C:\Python36\Scripts\", "User")

5. In command prompt type: C:\python
   If this command returns the version number of your python, congradulations!
